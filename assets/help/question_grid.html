	<h1>Question Grid Help</h1>
	
	<p>Grids will not be displayed in a grid format in the administration 
		system for easier editing and organization.  Please view the public
		application to preview the final grid format once you have fully assembled
		your list of elements in the grid.</p>
	
	<p>Set the number of columns and column headings using the <b>Column Headings</b>
		field.  When the formatted grid is displayed on an application, the 
		elements will be added left-to-right.  A new row will be created depending
		on the number of columns you've set for the grid.  For example, if your 
		<b>Column Headings</b> are "Column 1;Column 2;Column 3", then you have three
		columns and every three elements added to the grid will create a new 
		row in the grid.</p>
